# SimpleMathGameV2
This math game is a second version of my very first program but this one is built in different programming paradigm - OOP
<h2> Sequel nobody asked for </h2>
<p> This is the second version of the SimpleMathGame that I have originally uploaded on github. It contains more advanced difficulty level, player can check every
answer, problem and correct solution they have provided.</p>
<h2> The code </h2>
<p>This time the code is more clean than it was in the first version of the game - I tried to use my skills in objected oriented programming but now that I have released it
and actually obtained more knowladge I can see that it might need improvements which I am planning to do if the time allows me to. <br>
Problem is a class with multiple objects and methods that allowed me to not only make the code cleaner but to create a number generator based on the 
difficult the user have provided. In addition to that, I have created a different max difficult cap which you can easliy (I think) change in the main .cpp file.</p>
<h2> Have fun!</h2>
<p>I hope you like it! It's still not perfect but it is my first OOP program that finally got to see the surface of the Internet.</p>
